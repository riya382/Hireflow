🤖 Overview
HireFlow takes the guesswork out of interview prep. Instead of generic question banks, it reads your actual resume and the actual job description you're targeting, matches them, and builds a custom interview strategy around the gap between the two.
Parse & Match — upload a resume (or write a quick self-description) and paste a target job description; HireFlow scores the match and flags missing keywords, skills, and formatting issues
Strategy Generation — get a tailored set of technical and behavioral questions, grouped by section, along with a roadmap of skill gaps to close before the interview
Mock Interview — a timed, voice-enabled practice round where you answer each question live, exactly like the real thing
AI Scorecard — every answer is scored out of 10 with identified mistakes and an "expected reference answer," so feedback is specific, not generic
Built with React (Vite) on the frontend and Node.js / Express + MongoDB on the backend, with Google's Gemini API powering resume matching, question generation, and answer evaluation.

🧠 How the AI Pipeline Works
```
Resume + Job Description submitted
      │
      ▼
Gemini API matches resume content against JD
      │
      ├─ Match Score calculated (e.g. 92% — Strong match)
      └─ Skill gaps identified and surfaced
      │
      ▼
Gemini generates tailored Technical + Behavioral questions
      │
      ▼
User starts Mock Interview (timed, voice or text answers)
      │
      ▼
Each answer sent to Gemini for evaluation
      │
      ├─ Score out of 10
      ├─ Identified mistakes/gaps
      └─ Expected reference answer generated
      │
      ▼
Results compiled into Interview Performance Blueprint
      │
      ▼
Saved to MongoDB → accessible anytime via History
```
All AI calls are routed through the backend (Express + Gemini API), so API keys never reach the client.

🏗️ Architecture Highlights
Separate Frontend/Backend Deployments — React/Vite client on Vercel, Express API on Render, communicating over a CORS-secured REST API
JWT Auth with HTTP-only Cookies — secure, stateless authentication via `cookie-parser`
Protected Routes — a `Protected` wrapper component guards authenticated pages (`Home`, `Interview`, `MockInterview`, `History`) at the router level
Modular Routing — `authRouter` and `interviewRouter` cleanly separate auth and core interview logic on the backend
Stateful Mock Interview Flow — dedicated routes per interview session (`/mock-interview/:interviewId`, `/interview/:interviewId`) for resumable, shareable interview links
